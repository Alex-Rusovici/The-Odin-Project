    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Piri piri fried chicken is a twist on classic buttermilk fried chicken that incorporates popular African and Portuguese piri piri seasonings, such as birdâ€™s eye chili peppers, paprika, salt, lemon peels, oregano, and garlic, to create citrusy, garlicky, and herbal notes.

        I love exploring different spices in order to come up with new and exciting family meals. For me, this happens through travel (overseas), but it also happens at my local spice stores. During a "trip" one afternoon, I stumbled across a piri piri spice blend, did some research on the spice, and the rest was history! As my creative juices started flowing, I came up with this piri piri fried chicken.
