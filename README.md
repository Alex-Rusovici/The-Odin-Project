# The-Odin-Project
Work-Work

<h2><i>Dear diary,</i></h2>

<h3><i>19th of August 2022</i><h3>

<h4>As of today, I will start the Foundations path from the Odin Project.<h4>

<p>This means that in the next few days I will try to build the "Recipes" Project and maybe even build the "Landing page" Project. Because of the course that I take on Tuesday and Thursday, creating this first project will be a breeze, but I'm looking forward to sharpening my HTML skill and learning more about CSS.</p>
